# Drone-vs-Bird-Detection-using-YOLOv4-YOLOv5-YOLOv6-YOLOv7-and-YOLOv8
This project provides a comprehensive comparison of multiple YOLO versions applied to a Drone/Bird dataset already annotated in the YOLO format. The objective is to train different models, evaluate their performance, and deliver a clean, reproducible, and GitHub-ready project structure.
